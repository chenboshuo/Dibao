# Dibao Recommendation V2/V3 Design

This document records the phased V2/V3 recommendation architecture and the current implementation status. The ranking core remains local-first:

- No remote LLM.
- No remote reranker.
- No remote classifier.
- No external search service.
- The only optional remote dependency is one embedding provider.
- Scores, explanations, local model data, profile data, and evaluation logs are stored in SQLite.

## Implementation Status

### Implemented and active by default

- `004_recommendation_v2` plus append-only `005_recommendation_v2_completion`.
- Canonical rank context remains `article_rank_scores.rank_context`; there is no second `rank_context_id`.
- Ranking jobs persist `rerank_position`, and `view=recommended` reads that canonical order before falling back to score.
- Ranking setting changes enqueue a deduped `ranking_recalculate` job without enqueueing embedding, FTS, or vector rebuild jobs.
- Semantic ranking uses existing `interest_clusters`, recent intent vectors when present, and persisted score components.
- `profile_terms + FTS5 bm25()` participates in lexical candidate recall and `bm25_score`; token counts are not used as BM25.
- Candidate recall is bucketed in the full recalculation path: must-include, recency, semantic, lexical, and diversity buckets are unioned before scoring.
- `interest_cluster_evidence` is written for live cluster updates and read before dynamic diagnostics fallback.
- Duplicate rebuild includes exact keys and bounded simhash near-duplicate grouping; ranking reads persisted duplicate groups for penalties.
- Feed source normalization writes Bayesian smoothing fields and ranking prefers them when available.
- Recent intent rebuild uses existing embeddings only and does not call an embedding provider.
- Offline evaluation writes `lightweight_replay_diagnostic` metrics from sampled cutoffs and labels; it is not full strict replay and not causal A/B evidence.

### Implemented but shadow or disabled

- FTRL training generates examples and weights locally. Transparency distinguishes `disabled`, `shadow_no_samples`, `insufficient_samples`, `shadow_trained`, `active`, and `failed`. It writes non-zero shadow `ftrl_score`, but final ranking uses it only after explicit local promotion, sufficient samples, `localLearningEnabled=true`, and `localLearningShadowMode=false`.
- Micro-exploration currently exposes bounded local exploration bonus/slot state. It must be shown as `enabled_bonus_only` until bucket alpha/beta statistics are used for slot selection.

### Planned / disabled

- Full strict replay remains planned. Current evaluation is `lightweight_replay_diagnostic`; it uses local bounded replay terms and may approximate historical table state.

## Rank Context

`article_rank_scores.rank_context` remains the canonical context id. There is no second `rank_context_id`.

V2 contexts use:

```text
rec_v2:<base|embedding>:cocoon_<level>:schema_2
```

`rank_contexts.id` is equal to `article_rank_scores.rank_context`. Legacy contexts such as `base` and older embedding-index ids remain readable and are used as fallback.

## Score And Explanation Storage

`article_rank_scores` stores numeric score fields only:

- final score
- pre-rerank score
- base score
- FTRL shadow score
- semantic score
- BM25/keyword score
- source score
- freshness score
- state score
- negative, duplicate, diversity, exposure penalties
- exploration and pending-embedding bonuses
- canonical `rerank_position`
- algorithm version, feature schema version, and cocoon level

`article_rank_explanations` is the authoritative explanation payload store. Explanations are deterministic templates generated from persisted score components and evidence refs.

## Candidate Generation

Target V2 is structured around bucketed recall, not one global pre-union cap:

- must-include: favorite, read-later, recently opened unfinished, fresh pending embeddings, high source-weight feeds
- recency: fresh articles and recent hot-window articles
- semantic: active embedding profile and cluster matches
- lexical: local FTS/BM25 and keyword profile signals
- diversity: low-exposure feeds and underrepresented duplicate groups

The full recalculation path uses independent bucket queries and stores candidate origins in the explanation payload. Cursor chunk recalculation may still use the compatibility candidate query for resumability.

## Hybrid Scoring

V2 score combines:

- long-term semantic interest from `interest_clusters`
- top-k weighted positive and negative cluster matching instead of single max cosine
- local keyword/BM25 score from active `profile_terms + FTS5 bm25()`
- freshness
- source normalization
- article state
- pending embedding floor
- duplicate, negative, exposure, and diversity penalties
- optional exploration bonus

`latest` sorting is not affected.

## Interest Clusters

`interest_clusters` remains the long-term semantic profile store.

Implemented behavior:

- positive clusters use top-k weighted average, default k = 4
- negative clusters use top-k weighted average, default k = 3
- cluster weights use log normalization and caps
- negative signals are used for similar-content penalties and explicit filters
- `open` and single impressions are not strong long-term preference signals

`interest_cluster_evidence` stores future cluster evidence. Reconstructed evidence must set `evidence_source = "reconstructed"` and a confidence value; live event evidence uses `live_event`.

## FTS / BM25

`article_fts` remains the local FTS5 index. Queries are sanitized before `MATCH`.

Search uses:

```sql
bm25(article_fts, 5.0, 2.0, 0.6)
```

The direction is SQLite FTS5 native: lower BM25 rank is more relevant. `article_rank_scores.bm25_score` must only be populated from `profile_terms + FTS5 bm25()` after P1. It must not be populated from token counts, title length, summary length, or text density.

## Source Normalization

Source influence combines:

- user `sourceWeight`
- exposure-normalized positive/negative feed stats
- low-confidence open-only behavior with very small weight

High-frequency feeds should not dominate only because they publish more. Source contribution remains bounded below content-interest features.

## Cocoon Level

Setting key: `recommendation.settings.cocoonLevel`

Range: `1..10`

Default: `5`, to avoid surprising migration behavior.

Neutral interpretation:

- lower: more open, distributed, and exploratory
- higher: more personalized, stable, and less disruptive

Hard constraints:

- level 1 never recommends outside subscribed feeds
- level 10 never bypasses explicit hide/not-interested filters
- level 10 never bypasses dedupe or freshness floor
- duplicate groups cannot flood the list at any level

Changing cocoon level triggers a deduped ranking recalculation only. It does not require new embeddings, FTS rebuild, or vector rebuild.

## Canonical Rerank

MMR is list-level. Dibao uses a background canonical order approach:

- ranking jobs calculate a hot window
- source and duplicate diversity penalties are applied while selecting the canonical order
- `rerank_position`, `rerank_score`, and `rerank_window_id` are persisted in `article_rank_scores`
- recommended pages read persisted rank scores/order and fall back to legacy/base scores if needed

## V3 Local Learning, Exploration, Evaluation

V3 features are local and feature-flagged:

- `recommendation.localLearning.enabled`
- `recommendation.localLearning.shadowMode`
- `recommendation.exploration.enabled`
- `recommendation.evaluation.enabled`

FTRL is shadow-mode by default. It is trained locally from low-dimensional normalized ranking features, not raw embedding dimensions.

Offline evaluation is currently `lightweight_replay_diagnostic`. It stores subset metrics such as cutoff count, label count, hit@10, nDCG@10, and MRR, but it is not full strict replay and must not be described as causal A/B proof.

## Migration And Backfill

Migration `004_recommendation_v2`:

- preserves existing tables and primary keys
- appends nullable score columns to `article_rank_scores`
- adds derived-data tables for rank contexts, evidence, fingerprints, duplicates, local learning, exploration, evaluation, and backfill state
- expands job types with a recreate-copy-rename migration

Migration `005_recommendation_v2_completion` is append-only and safe for databases that already applied `004`. It adds FTRL state columns (`z`, `n`), source normalization derived fields on `feed_stats`, and non-unique indexes for P1/P2 work. It intentionally avoids unique indexes that could fail on dirty derived rows.

Live migration is gated. Use:

```bash
DIBAO_ALLOW_LIVE_MIGRATION=1 \
DIBAO_DB_BACKUP_CONFIRMED=1 \
DIBAO_DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/dibao.sqlite \
npm run ops:migrate:recommendation-v2
```

The script creates a timestamped backup, prints backup size and SHA-256, records pre/post table counts, and verifies legacy data counts are unchanged.

## Maintenance APIs

All endpoints require authentication and dedupe queued/running work:

- `POST /api/recommendation/recalculate`
- `POST /api/recommendation/backfill/fingerprints`
- `POST /api/recommendation/rebuild-duplicates`
- `POST /api/recommendation/rebuild-keywords`
- `POST /api/recommendation/evaluate`
- `POST /api/recommendation/ftrl/reset`
- `POST /api/recommendation/ftrl/promote`

The background maintenance endpoints return a job id and dedupe queued/running work. FTRL reset is immediate and local. FTRL promote is immediate, local, and returns `409` until the shadow model has at least 50 high-quality samples and a positive blend alpha.
