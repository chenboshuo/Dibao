# Dibao v0.1.1 Release Test Report

Test window: 2026-05-30 CST

Branch: `release/v0.1.1`

Workspace: `/Users/jeffreywang/dev/邸报`

## Release Decision

This report is the live evidence log for the v0.1.1 release branch. The branch must remain untagged until the validation table is complete and the user explicitly approves the `main` merge and `v0.1.1` tag.

## Gate Results

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run typecheck --workspaces --if-present` | Pass | All workspaces typechecked at `0.1.1`. |
| `npm test --workspaces --if-present` | Pass | 20 test files, 310 tests passed across workspaces. |
| `npm run build --workspaces --if-present` | Pass | Server and workspace TS builds passed; Web production bundle built with the existing large-chunk warning. |
| `npm run spike:sqlite-vec` | Pass | sqlite-vec `v0.1.9`; FTS, KNN, row mapping, and rebuild checks passed. |
| `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --load --secret id=dibao_sentry_config,src=config/sentry.json -t dibao:v0.1.1 .` | Pass | Built local release image with private Sentry build config. |
| Docker Sentry config verification | Pass | Runtime and browser bundle booleans were all true for `hasDsn`, `hasOrg`, and `hasProject`; no secret values were printed. |
| v0.1.1 fresh Docker install | Pass | Empty volume started healthy with `version: 0.1.1` and `setupCompleted:false`. |
| v0.1.0 -> v0.1.1 Docker upgrade | Pass | Previous-release volume started at `0.1.0`, upgraded to `0.1.1`, applied `018`, retained setup, and had `interest_cluster_calibrations`. |
| `docker compose config --quiet` | Pass | Compose config is valid after making the host port overridable with default `8080`. |
| `npm run smoke:docker-recommendation` | Pass | Provider setup, backfill, personalized recommendation mode, full embedding coverage, and recommended list passed. |
| `npm run perf:recommendation` | Pass | 20k-article benchmark regenerated `docs/recommendation-performance.md`; recommended API 47.0 ms, diagnostics/index API 135.1 ms. |
| `npm run e2e` | Pass | 16/16 Playwright desktop/mobile tests passed. |
| `git diff --check` | Pass | No whitespace errors before final release commit. |

## Synology Regression Evidence From Dev Validation

Before cutting this release branch, the v0.1.1 clustering fix was deployed to the Synology permanent test instance on the validated `dev` image `dibao:50d2dbb`.

Observed results:

- Active embedding index: `index_270d90228b112a72f300`
- SQL migration: `018_interest_cluster_calibrations.sql`
- Derived-data upgrade: `v0.1.1-interest-profile-calibration-rebuild`
- Calibration confidence: high
- Calibration samples: positive 160, negative 82, background 260
- Positive merge threshold: `0.7316`
- Negative merge threshold: `0.6956`
- Positive clusters: 39; singleton clusters: 12; max sample count: 14; sample sum: 121
- Negative clusters: 32; singleton clusters: 25; max sample count: 5; sample sum: 46
- Positive families: 5
- Negative families: 7
- Known regression articles were not assigned to the same broad cluster/family at the release acceptance threshold.
- Upgrade copy in the bundled Web app states that the migration does not rebuild embeddings and will not create API cost.

This Synology validation is not a replacement for release install/upgrade gates. It records the data-specific regression closure that motivated v0.1.1.

## Migration Verification

New SQL migration after v0.1.0:

- `018_interest_cluster_calibrations.sql`

Blocking derived-data upgrade:

- `v0.1.1-interest-profile-calibration-rebuild`

Embedding recomputation: not required and not performed by the migration.

## Docker Release Image

Target immutable image:

```text
ghcr.io/pls-1q43/dibao:v0.1.1
```

Moving aliases such as `stable` and `latest` must not be moved until the user approves the final tag/release operation.

Local Sentry verification for the release image:

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "hasDsn": true,
    "hasOrg": true,
    "hasProject": true
  },
  "browser": {
    "hasDsn": true,
    "hasOrg": true,
    "hasProject": true
  }
}
```

The final GHCR image must be checked with the same boolean-only probe after the tag-triggered publish completes.
