# Dibao v0.1.0 Release Checklist

Last updated: 2026-05-16

Target tag: `v0.1.0`

Candidate branch: `main`

## Release Decision

`main` is a v0.1.0 release candidate after the RC closure commit is merged. Do not tag until all pre-tag gates below are green on the exact commit that will be tagged.

## Blocking Pre-Tag Items

| Status | Item | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Done | Version bump | Root/workspace package versions, internal workspace deps, `package-lock.json`, shared `dibaoVersion`, version tests, and API/docs examples are aligned to `0.1.0`. |
| Done | Docker build verification | `docker build -t dibao:local .` succeeds. If the shell lacks `docker`, use Docker Desktop bundled CLI with `/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin` on `PATH`. |
| Done | Compose verification | `docker compose config` succeeds. |
| Done | Docker recommendation smoke | `npm run smoke:docker-recommendation` reaches full embedding coverage and returns recommended articles. |
| Done | Browser RC smoke | First-run setup, RSS, Ollama/bge-m3 provider, backfill, recommended, explanation, actions, and settings diagnostics pass in a real browser session. |
| Done | Release gates | Every command in the pre-tag validation section passes on the RC closure working tree. |

## Pre-Tag Validation

Run from a clean checkout of `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
git status -sb
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run spike:sqlite-vec
npm run e2e
docker build -t dibao:local .
docker compose config
npm run smoke:docker-recommendation
npm run perf:recommendation
DIBAO_RUN_OLLAMA_TESTS=true npm run test:ollama:optional
git diff --check
```

Expected result:

- Git worktree is clean except for intentional release artifacts before the RC commit.
- All npm validation commands pass.
- E2E passes on desktop and mobile Chromium projects.
- Docker image builds.
- Compose config is valid.
- Docker recommendation smoke completes provider setup, backfill, diagnostics, and recommended list checks.
- Performance report is regenerated or confirmed in `docs/recommendation-performance.md`.
- Real Ollama probe passes with the user's local provider, currently `bge-m3` with dimension `1024`.

## Functional MVP Acceptance

| Area | Status | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single-user setup/auth | Done | First-run password setup, login, logout, session cookie, and protected APIs work. |
| RSS reader | Done | User can add RSS/Atom feeds, refresh, list articles, and open article detail. |
| OPML | Done | User can import/export OPML through Web UI. |
| Feed management | Done | User can create/rename/delete folders, edit feeds, disable feeds, and soft-delete feeds. |
| Article actions | Done | Favorite, read later, read/unread, not interested, and read progress actions persist and update behavior data. |
| Background refresh | Done | Enabled feeds can be refreshed through jobs; failures are isolated and recorded. |
| Retention | Done | Article retention cleanup preserves behavior/profile data and clears serving indexes. |
| Settings | Done | Language, reader settings, retention days, and embedding provider settings persist. |
| Embedding providers | Done | OpenAI-compatible and Ollama providers can be saved, enabled, tested, and used for embedding jobs. |
| Embedding backfill | Done | Active indexes can enqueue missing/stale article embeddings without conflating with sqlite-vec rebuild. |
| sqlite-vec | Done | Vectors can be stored, rebuilt, and queried through sqlite-vec. |
| Profile/ranking | Done | Behavior events update profile clusters; recommended ranking uses active context with baseline and pending fallbacks. |
| Diagnostics | Done | Recommendation status, embedding index coverage, and safe jobs list APIs expose useful state without secrets or raw payloads. |
| Explanation | Done | Recommendation explanation displays baseline and interest-related reasons. |
| Docker self-host path | Done | Dockerfile, Compose config, static Web serving, health check, and recommendation smoke are in place. |
| E2E smoke | Done | Local no-network desktop/mobile Playwright smoke passes. |
| User docs | Done | README and release docs cover deployment, setup, provider configuration, backfill/rebuild concepts, data persistence, backup, upgrade, FAQ, and dev commands. |

## Known v0.1.0 Boundaries

- Single-user only. No multi-user, OAuth, account management, or official hosted service.
- Self-hosted local SQLite only. No cloud sync.
- MVP supports OpenAI-compatible and Ollama embedding endpoints. Custom HTTP and embedded local models are future adapters.
- Provider API keys are stored in local SQLite using the current MVP local-storage strategy, not a full secret-management system.
- Search UI, PWA installability, native mobile packaging, full mobile polish, diversity reranking, duplicate penalties, and full model migration UX are post-MVP work.
- Recommendation quality is usable for trial but should keep improving through more behavior signals, diversity, duplicate handling, and better profile rebuild tooling.
- Performance benchmark is a manual release gate; it records local evidence but does not enforce hard pass/fail latency thresholds yet.

## Tagging Commands

Do not run these until all blocking pre-tag items are done and the user explicitly approves tagging.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Dibao v0.1.0"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

## Recommended GitHub Release Settings

- Release title: `Dibao v0.1.0`
- Mark as latest release: yes.
- Mark as prerelease: recommended `yes`, because this is the first public MVP.
- Attachments: none required for source release.
- Body: use `docs/release-notes-v0.1.0.md`.
